# exerciseminimilism
A small, single html file and browser local storage solution for tracking a fixed, rotating set of daily exercises from one week to the next.

It will only ever show today's workout. There is no history, trending or reporting possible.

It has no configuration interface to keep it simple. Edit the html file source in order to set your exercises. Only the previous weight is tracked to allow setting of the next weight.

Includes a very simple built-in timer for tracking rest periods. You can change the sound by inserting a different base64 encoded wav.
